Purpose:
-----------
This repository will contain IPython Notebooks and Python files documenting methods that summarize and visualize the National Fish Habitat Partnership's (NFHP) National Inland Assessment of Fish Habitats (2015)
to ecological and jurisdictional boundaries that may be relevant to conservation decisions (e.g. National Park Boundaries, Hydrological Units, States).  

Often biologist, park managers and other decision makers are confronted with the need to prioritize funding of conservation and restoration efforts with limited resources and information to make these decisions.
These summaries of NFHP data are intended to give a user an additional set of information helping them better understand implications of fish habitat condition within their jurisdiction and associated ecological units. 
More specificly this information is anticipated to help ensure the user is considering appropriate disturbances at appropriate spatial scales when making decisions about fish habitat. A few more directed use cases are described below.

For smaller spatial units and jurisdictions, managers are likely to be aware of specific disturbances and associated issues with fish habitat, but
landscape level influences may be less intuitive and harder to quantify.  These users can use the NFHP summaries to help understand a quick overview of disturbances and spatial scales (e.g. especially network disturbances) to further 
investigate through exploring NFHP's catchment level information (i.e. habitat condition scores, significant disturbance metrics, and disturbance summaries) and other finer resolution sources of information that may be available.
  
In cases where several ecological units are within a larger jurisdiction a decision maker can quickly compare overall risk of fish habitat degredation and influencing disturbances.  Again these findings can be further 
investigated by exploring NFHP's catchment level information (i.e. habitat condition scores, significant disturbance metrics, and disturbance summaries) and other finer resolution sources of information that may be available.

Additional Details:
-----------
The source data include habitat condition indicies and select landscape disturbances (having nationaly consistent coverage) that influence fish habitat at 4 spatial scales (i.e. local catchment, network catchment, local catchment buffer, and 
network catchment buffers) for over 2 million stream segments of the National Hydrography Plus Version 1 datasets within the conterminous United States. Use this link to find out more about the 
NFHP source data being used in these efforts: https://doi.org/10.5066/F73R0R1P.    
  
This repository currently provides methods of summarizing information to spatial units of interest in the notebook: nfhp-2015-hci-summarized-using-midpoint.ipynb
Curent summarization methods take NFHP data (at the stream reach scale) and summarize it to the spatial unit of interest.  A stream reach is included in a summary if it's midpoint falls within
the spatial unit.  Habitat condition indicies are then summarized using a length-weighted average.  Disturbance variables for each of the four spatial scales are summarized by combining lists
of disturbances from individual stream reaches into a common list of unique values.   
  
This repository currently provides methods of visualizing summarized NFHP data in the following ways.	  
	1. Display total kilometers of NHDPlusV1 streams being scored by NFHP within a spatial unit (nfhp-2015-hci-total-stream-km-scored-per-spatial-unit.ipynb)	  
	2. Display length-weighted averages of fish habitat condition indicies for a given spatial unit. (nfhp-2015-place-name-summaries.ipynb)	  
	3. Display disturbance variables that influenced fish habitat condition within a given spatial unit. (nfhp-2015-table-of-significant-disturbances-per-spatial-unit.ipynb)
